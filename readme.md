# Online Map Construction Benchmark

This is a benchmark for online local map construction tasks. The goal of this task is using onboard sensor observation (cameras images/LiDAR scans) to construct local HD map.

Typically, local maps can be represented by rasterized output or vectorized output. We set benchmark for two tasks termed rasterized map construction and vectorized map construction.

#### Rasterized map construction

The goal of rasterized map construction is to output a segmentation image of bird's-eye-view for each sample. Each pixel on the rasterized image corresponds to a grid on ground surface. Here is an example.

We use Intersection over Union (IoU) as metric to evaluate the quality of construction.

#### Vectorized map construction

The goal of vectorized map construction is to output a sparse set of polylines. Polylines serve as primitives to model the geometry of maps elements. Here is an example.

We use Chamfer Distance based Average Precision (AP) as metric to evaluate the quality of construction as introduced in [HDMapNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06307) and [VectorMapNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08920). For details of evaluation metrics, please see [Evaluation.md](https://github.com/Tsinghua-MARS-Lab/Online_Map_Construction_Benchmark/blob/master/resources/Evaluation.md).

Currently we build our benchmark on the [nuScenes](www.nuscenes.org) dataset. We include three types of map elements: pedestrian crossing, lane divider and road boundary. We provide baseline models, data processing pipelines and evaluation kit for both rasterized and vectorized tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first online local map construction benchmark. We hope this benchmark could aid future research on online local map construction.

#### 2. Data Preparation

**Step 1.** Download [nuScenes](www.nuscenes.org) dataset and assume the path is `/path/to/nuScenes/`.

**Step 2.** Make a softlink under `dataset` folder.

```



## Baseline Models

We provide a baseline model for each of the two tasks: [HDMapNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06307) for rasterized construction and [VectorMapNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08920) for vectorized construction.

```
bash tools/dist_train.sh plugin/configs/vector/vectormapnet_nusc.py 8
```



## Evaluation

For details of evaluation metrics, please see [Evaluation.md](https://github.com/Tsinghua-MARS-Lab/Online_Map_Construction_Benchmark/blob/master/resources/Evaluation.md).

#### To evaluate a checkpoint

Single GPU evaluation

```
python tools/test.py ${CONFIG_PATH} --checkpoint ${CHECKPOINT} --eval
```

For example

```
python tools/test.py plugin/configs/vector/vectormapnet_nusc.py --checkpoint work_dirs/vectormapnet_nusc/latest.pth --eval
```

Multi GPUs evaluation

```
bash tools/dist_test.sh ${CONFIG_PATH} --checkpoint ${CHECKPOINT} ${NUM_GPUS} --eval 
```

#### To evaluate a submission file

```
python tools/test.py ${CONFIG_PATH} --result-path ${RESULT_PATH} --eval
```

For example

```
python tools/test.py plugin/configs/vector/vectormapnet_nusc.py --result-path work_dirs/vectormapnet_nusc/submission_vector.pkl --eval
```

Evaluating a checkpoint will automatically generate a submission file. Or you can generate one by running

```
python tools/test.py ${CONFIG_PATH} --checkpoint ${CHECKPOINT} --format-only
```



## Visualization

Visualization tools can be used to visualize ground-truth labels and model's prediction results. For rasterized model, only a rasterized BEV segmentation image will be generated. For vectorized model, map labels are projected on surrounding camera images and six images will be saved. 

To visualize ground-truth labels

```
python tools/visualization/visualize.py ${CONFIG_PATH} ${DATA_IDX}
```

To visualize both ground-truth and prediction labels

```
python tools/visualization/visualize.py ${CONFIG_PATH} ${DATA_IDX} --result ${RESULT_PATH}
```

For example

```
python tools/visualization/visualize.py \
	plugin/configs/vector/vectormapnet_nusc.py \
	5 \
	--result work_dirs/vectormapnet_nusc/submission_vector.pkl
```
